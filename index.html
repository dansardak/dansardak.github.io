          <p>Military logistics rely heavily on public infrastructure, such as highways and railways, to transport troops, equipment, and supplies, linking critical installations through the Department of Defense’s Strategic Highway Network and Strategic Rail Corridor Network. However, these networks are vulnerable to disruptions that can jeopardize operational readiness, particularly in contested environments where adversaries employ non-traditional threats to disrupt logistics, even within the homeland. This paper presents a contested logistics model that utilizes network science and Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate the robustness and resilience of strategic transportation networks under various disruption scenarios. By integrating GIS data to model logistics networks, simulating disruptions, and quantifying their impacts, we identified vulnerabilities in US power projection routes and assessed the resilience and robustness of highways and railways. Our findings reveal that highways are more resilient than railways, with greater capacity to absorb targeted disruptions.. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing investments in highway infrastructure and reinforcing vulnerable road and rail segments, particularly in high-risk regions, to enhance the resilience of military logistics and maintain operational effectiveness in contested conditions.</p>

          <p>Network science is a powerful tool for analyzing transportation networks, offering insights into their structures and enabling the quantification of resilience and robustness. Understanding the underlying structures of transportation networks is crucial for effective infrastructure planning and maintenance. In military contexts, network science is valuable for analyzing logistics networks, critical for the movement and supply of troops and equipment. The U.S. Army’s logistical success, particularly in the “fort-to-port” phase, relies heavily on the Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) in the U.S., which is a system of public highways crucial for military deployments. However, the shared nature of these networks with civilian users introduces unique challenges, including vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and physical sabotage, which is highlighted by the concept of contested logistics. This paper proposes a method that uses network science and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the robustness and resilience of transportation networks, specifically applied to military logistics. Our findings indicate that, while the STRAHNET is robust against targeted disruptions, it is more resilient to random disruptions.</p>
